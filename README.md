# SG Bus Data

> Singapore Bus data

This is a data-only repository to complement [BusRouter SG](https://github.com/cheeaun/busrouter-sg/).

## The data

It's in the `/data` folder.

Or, browse through them on the data server: https://data.busrouter.sg/

## Terminologies

- **Stop** - the bus stop itself
- **Service** - the bus service, with numbers like `133` or `1N`
- **Route** - the route of a bus service, the lines connecting all the stops
- **Pattern** - the patterns of a bus route, _one_ of the lines connecting the stops
  - If the route is one-way (A->B), there's only one pattern
  - If the route is two-way (A->B, B->A), there're two patterns in a route
  - Each pattern usually pass through different stops, as they're usually on opposite sides of the road.

## Scripts

### `npm run datamall`

> ⚠️ This requires `DatamallAccountKey` environment variable. Make a copy of `example.env` file, rename to `.env` and put in your [Datamall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/) [API key](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/request-for-api.html).
